# svg-logo-maker

## Description

I created this SVG Logo maker to help users create simple SVG's. 



## Installation
To use this application, user will need to have Node and VS code installed.

## Usage

To use this application, run node index.js in the integrated terminal in VS code. Users will be prompted with 4 questions. Once all prompts are answered, a logo.svg file will be generated and ready to use!

## Credits
I used https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp for reference on this project. I also received help from my tutor, Josshy Olea, my instructor, Max, as well as the coursework for week 10 as a reference point. 


## Tests

For testing, type 'npm run test' into the intergrated terminal to verify all shapes are rendering correctly.
